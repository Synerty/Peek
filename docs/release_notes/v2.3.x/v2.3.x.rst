Migration Steps

peek-plugin-pof-diagram-loader
``````````````````````````````

In PEEK-526, the "Layer Profile Name" has been renamed to
"Environment Name" in the plugin settings.

The migration steps for this change are as follows:

* Login to Peek Admin,

* Go to plugin "PowerOn ADMS Diagram Loader"

* Go to the "Edit App Server Settings" tab.

* Update "Environment Name" to a value
  from "ENMAC"."ENVIRONMENT_LIST"."ENVIRONMENT_NAME"
  that you wish the diagram to load with.

* Click Save

* Run the following as peek on the peek server to force a reload of the data: ::

    psql <<EOF
    UPDATE pl_pof_diagram_loader."PageLoadState"
    SET "lastDisplayHash"='reloadme';
    EOF

* Restart the peek agent. ::

    sudo systemctl restart peek_agent


v2.3.0 Issues Log
-----------------

Bug
```

*    [PEEK-602] - PoF Diagram Loader - Agent no longer reloads all pages on restart.

New Feature
```````````

*    [PEEK-526] - Implement support for loading in PowerOn ADMS "Poke Points".
     These are hotspots that jump the user to another location on the diagram
     when clicked.

CI/CD Tasks
```````````

*    [PEEK-601] - Setup Peek release builds to pin Docker and Python dependencies
     for the life of that release branch. (EG v2.2.7 will have the exact same python
     dependency packages, Twisted, SQLAlchemy, VortexPY, etc as v2.2.0)
