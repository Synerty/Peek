v3.4.x Release Notes
====================

Platform Changes
----------------

This release contains a major redevelopment for the offline capabilities
of Peek.

There are significant performance and memory improvements to the vortex
libraries and all plugins containing data indexes.

Major Plugin Changes
--------------------

Introduction of the Diagram PDF Exporter plugin.

v3.4.0 introduces PDF export support for the DMS Network Diagram. This allows
either the visible network or trace context to be exported as a PDF document
which the user can then download. When the Trace Export is selected, the
area of the network which contains the trace is exported. Alternatively,
when Visible Network is selected, the area of the network visible to the
user will be the area exported. Page size, orientation, and maximum pages can
be set to customise the PDF.

v3.4.0 introduces Light Mode, this feature replaces the background of the
network diagram with a white background and inverts only the colours
necessary to be visible on a white background. The initial migration
automatically detects and populates the light mode colours. The colours can
be manually updated if required. Simply clicking the button in the network
diagram will enable light mode, increasing the
readability of the network diagram if required.

Deployment Changes

Migration Steps
---------------

Open Street Map Lookups File Migration
``````````````````````````````````````

#. Locate the **lookups.csv** file. The file location can be found in the
   configuration tab of the Open Street Map Loader in Peek Admin.
#. Open the **lookups.csv** with a spreadsheet editor. Eg. Microsoft Excel
#. Remove :code:`Point` from the **acceptedGeometries** where **isRoadName** =
   :code:`TRUE`. Eg. :code:`LineString, Point` becomes :code:`Linestring`
#. Duplicate all rows where **isRoadName** = :code:`TRUE`.
#. In the original rows; Update the **option.isRoadName** to :code:`FALSE`.
#. In the new duplicated rows:

    #. Append the **importHash** value with :code:`_road_name`. Eg.
       :code:`osm:highways:motorway1` becomes
       :code:`osm:highways:motorway1_road_name`
    #. Increment the **level.order** value by :code:`1`.
#. **Restart** Peek Agent :code:`sudo systemctl restart peek_agent`
#. **Touch** the geojson file. The file location can be found in the
   configuration tab of the Open Street Map Loader in Peek Admin. ::

        touch [GEOJSON FILE NAME]


.. note:: Synerty recommends running the Initial Load Attune Blueprint for
    faster loading of the PowerOn data.
