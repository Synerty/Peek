v3.1.x Release Notes
====================

Platform Changes
----------------
Peek v3.1.0 is largely a stability and quality of life update. Few new features
have been added, as the focus has been on finding and fixing any pain points
or errors present after the major upgrades made in Peek 3.0.

One new feature that was added to Peek v3.1.0 is an improved API for GPS
support.

Major Plugin Changes
--------------------
We specifically avoided making any major changes to existing plugins in this
release. One new plugin was created and is expected to improve an expand GPS
usage in Peek significantly in future releases.

Deployment Changes

Deployment of the Peek platform now builds several prerequisites from source,
as opposed to using a package manager,
resulting in an equivalent installation across all supported platforms.
