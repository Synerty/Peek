==================================
Windows Requirements Install Guide
==================================

The Peek platform is designed to run on Linux, however, it is compatible with windows.
Please read through all of the documentation before commencing the installation
procedure.

Installation Objective
----------------------

This *Installation Guide* contains specific Windows operating system requirements for the
configuring of synerty-peek.

Required Software
`````````````````

Some of the software to be installed requires internet access.  For offline installation
some steps are required to be installed on another online server for the files to be
packaged and transferred to the offline server.

Below is a list of all the required software:

*  Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1
*  Visual C++ Build Tools 2015
*  Microsoft速 SQL Server速 2014 Express
*  Node.js 7+ and NPM 3+
*  Python 3.5
*  FreeTDS
*  GitBash
*  Shapely
*  Cygwin

Optional  Software
``````````````````

*  7zip
*  Notepad ++
*  Installing Oracle Libraries (Instructions in the procedure)

Installation of 7zip is optional. This tool will come in handy during the process but
is not required.

----

Installation of Notepad ++ is optional.  Notepad ++ is a handy tool for viewing
documents and has useful features.

----

Installing Oracle Libraries is required if you intend on installing the peek agent.
Instruction for installing the Oracle Libraries are in the *Online Installation Guide*.

OS Commands
-----------

The config file for each service in the peek platform describes the location of the BASH
interpreter. Peek is coded to use the bash interpreter and basic posix compliant utilities
for all OS commands.

When peek generates it's config it should automatically choose the right interpreter. ::

        "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" if isWindows else "/bin/bash"
